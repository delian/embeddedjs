# Reimplementation of the Embedded JS from http://embeddedjs.com

Hello to all. I love the Embedded JS. It is simple, fast and functional.
But it is not supported and updated for a while.
Of course there are lot other embedded javascript implementations,
but most of them are hard to use or also out of support.
This is not a problem by itself, but the web browsers evolve and we synchronous XMLHttpRequest is not supported anymore in the main thread.
Which means the EJS has to be rewritten to be asynchronous.
And as I need it asynchronous, I wrote the code in ES5 which essentially makes it faster and much simpler.

So welcome to the new asynchronous and modern EJS implementation.
